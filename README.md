# C# Projects Repository

Welcome to my personal repository where I share my projects for practicing the C# language. You can explore them on different project branches:

1. **Number Guesser**: This is my inaugural C# project, featuring a game where you attempt to guess the correct number within the console. Developing this project acquainted me with Visual Studio 2022, the fundamental structure of C# using .NET, functions, and basic data types.

2. ""Blog MVC"": In my second project, I delved into a Full Stack C# environment with ASP.NET. This project broadened my understanding of SQL Server and its GUI (SQL Server Management Studio), as well as Migrations with Entity Framework. Additionally, I learned how to populate a database with data sourced from a User Interface.
