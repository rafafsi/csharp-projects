# C# Projects Repository

Welcome to my personal repository where I share my projects for practicing the C# language. You can explore them on different project branches:

1. **Number Guesser**: This is my inaugural C# project, featuring a game where you attempt to guess the correct number within the console. Developing this project acquainted me with Visual Studio 2022, the fundamental structure of C# using .NET, functions, and basic data types.

2. **Blog MVC**: In my second project, I delved into a Full Stack C# environment with ASP.NET in a Blog structured with a MVC architecture (Model-View-Controller). This project broadened my understanding of SQL Server and its GUI (SQL Server Management Studio), as well as Migrations with Entity Framework. Additionally, I learned how to populate a database with data sourced from a User Interface.

3. **Simple ASP.NET routes**: In my third branch iteration, I honed my skills in crafting streamlined CRUD routes within an ASP.NET backend. I delved deeper into leveraging middlewares, both built-in and custom, to enhance functionality. Additionally, I further explored the intricacies of dependency injection, ensuring a more robust and maintainable codebase.

4. **RabbitMQ Integration**: In my forth project, I ventured into the world of message brokers with RabbitMQ. This endeavor allowed me to explore asynchronous communication patterns within C#, demonstrating the power and versatility of RabbitMQ in handling message queues. Through this project, I gained invaluable insights into message queuing systems and enhanced my skills in building resilient and scalable applications.
